You are generating an entirely new full-stack 
application that replaces the functionality of the 
attached HTML file (AI Prompt Builder UI). Rebuild 
the system using modern, production-ready 
architecture with the following constraints: 
======================== ### SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS 
======================== 1. **Frontend**
   - Next.js 15 (App Router) - Tailwind v4 - shadCN 
   UI (latest) - Typescript - Component-based 
   architecture - State management using Zustand - 
   Responsive layout - File structure must follow 
   best practices:
       /app /components /lib /db /types /styles 2. 
**Backend**
   - SQLite via Drizzle ORM - Tables:
       - categories (id, name) - sections (id, 
       category_id, description, prompt_text) - 
       selected_sections (id, section_id) - 
       custom_prompt (id, text, enabled)
   - Provide migrations and schema - Backend 
   endpoints should be REST (or server actions) for:
       GET /categories POST /sections PUT 
       /sections/:id DELETE /sections/:id POST 
       /selection/:id DELETE /selection/:id GET 
       /prompt (returns compiled prompt string)
3. **Core Functionality to Reproduce from the 
provided HTML file**
   From the uploaded file, recreate these features:
      - Category list with collapsible sections - 
      Buttons for add/edit/delete - Checkbox 
      selection of prompt fragments - Live generated 
      prompt text panel - Copy-to-clipboard button - 
      Modal for creating/editing sections - Modal for 
      delete confirmation - Custom prompt input + 
      toggle enable switch - Everything must be 
      persisted in SQLite instead of localStorage
4. **Extensibility**
   The architecture must easily support:
      - New section categories - Theme switching - 
      User authentication in future versions - 
      Multi-user prompt libraries - Export/import of 
      prompt libraries
   Build the abstraction layers with this in mind. 5. 
**Docker Container**
   Produce a fully working Docker setup:
      - Dockerfile (multi-stage build) - 
      docker-compose.yml with:
           - app container - SQLite stored on a 
           mounted volume
      - README with step-by-step usage 
======================== ### OUTPUT REQUIREMENTS 
======================== For this single prompt, 
output: 1. **Project Scaffolding**
   Full file/folder tree 2. **Every File in the 
Repo**
   - All Next.js app code - All React components - 
   All shadCN UI components - Zustand store - 
   Tailwind config - Drizzle ORM schema + migrations 
   - API endpoints or server actions - Dockerfile + 
   docker-compose.yml - README.md
3. **Seed Script**
   Populate SQLite with the same default sections 
from the uploaded file. 4. **One-click Start 
Instructions**
   - `docker compose up` - site available at 
   `localhost:3000`
======================== ### ORIGINAL FILE FOR 
REFERENCE The full UI and behavior to recreate comes 
from `prompt_builder_10-29 V4.html`. It includes 
categories, modals, selection logic, default prompt 
text, custom prompts, and live assembly of the final 
prompt. Preserve all those UX expectations, but 
rebuild the entire codebase using the modern stack 
above. ======================== Now generate all code 
files needed for the full working project.
Do not summarize. Do not skip files. Output the complete project.
